# big-data

Project repository for the course [Big Data Architecture](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4305) at NTNU Trondheim, spring 2023. Made by [Hermann MÃ¸rkrid](https://github.com/hermannm) and [Lars Waage](https://github.com/larwaa).

## Project Structure

Each subfolder contains an assignment of the project, all implemented in Python.

- `spark` contains notebooks that use [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) to analyze the data in the `data` subfolder. The data was stored and analyzed on the [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) platform.
- `locality_sensitive_hashing` implements the [Locality-Sensitive Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) algorithm to analyze similarities between BBC articles in the `data/bbc` subfolder.
